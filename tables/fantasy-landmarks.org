The base of the tree as well as the ground around the alter are permanently stained a deep red. If the tree is cut, a thick blood sap seeps out of wound. If a creature is sacrificed on the alter, the blood pools near where the roots touch the alter and are absorbed while what appear to be veins appear on the tree that go up into the branches.

An assortment of precious gems are embedded in its surface. Any attempt to collect and/or destroy this construct will cause severe psychic damage and a loud high-pitched tone to play loudly.

Award inspiration for respectful offerings or prayers given to the statue.
  * The Dragonblood -- A massive artwork carved into a boulder placed some ways away from the banks of a nearby river.

  * The Daughter of the Sun -- An enormous stone of a singular soft yellow color. It is hot to the touch but by day it is warm and comfortable simply standing near it.

When a player next fails a roll, they may roll an additional d6 and add it to their total.
  * The Weeping Sister -- A fifteen-foot statue of a girl unmarred by time. Next to her are the shattered remains of another statue, close enough that the body may have once held her outstretched hand.

Water, clean and pure, travels down her face in steady rivulets but leaves no erosion there.
  * The Sensible Stone Head -a large stone head protruding from the surface of a glacier. It is the head of an earth elemental and if you get his attention, he is friendly.

Characters that throw rubbish, or are otherwise disrespectful of the well, find their respective objects on their person once more soaking wet and covered in bite marks.
  * Skilltown -- A small but clearly once-bustling town lays abandoned inside of a titan's skull. The skull is half buried in the sand; its eye sockets and mouth aim up at an angle.

It provides ample shade during most of the day.
  * Best Rest Graveyard -- A cleric once prayed over a graveyard that all within would ‘rest well.' Now anyone who falls asleep in that graveyard has the best night of sleep they've ever had.

If you happen to look up during the spring or fall, you'll see migratory birds alter their course to fly over this hill.

  * The Well -- A seemingly normal well on the top of a hill. Anything that is placed into it is immediately tossed out of it.
  * The Pariah's Mountain -One mountain among an otherwise unimpressive range, its only defining feature is its completely upside down. The base measures about 60ft across, but the peak 3,000ft up is easily a mile across. Stairs may have been carved into the side, but the climb down to the summit (or is it up to the base? The locals aren't quite sure) is precarious at times. The locals are also similarly vague when asked about what's on top...
  * Worried stones -- A group of 3 standing stones with anxiety. When encountered in their clearing, they will disappear once all eyes are off them. Careful inspection will reveal them to hiding nearby -- peeking from behind a nearby tree, bottom of a lake, hidden by bushes, behind where the party is now looking, etc. If discovered, they disappear again if not observed. The stones are not malicious, and do not harm the party. They would just rather you all left them to it, thank you.
  * The Quiet Creek -- An otherwise ordinary creek that runs through a forest. It is abnormally quiet near the stream, in such that there is almost no echo around it, and it is surprisingly hard to hear from a distance. All along its course stand small boulders, almost fully grown over with moss.
  * The Shifting Hills -- A large field of hills, dotted with rocks, grasses, and flowers. Careful study has found the hills are constantly moving, as though old creatures crawl along under a carpet of earth.

  * Ancient Battleground -- Deep in a forest, trees are marred with years old axe and sword marks. Hundreds of skeletons dressed in rusted armor and weapons lie in this area. Taking a trinket, or even loitering may be unwise.
  * True Clarity Bridge -- A bridge between two high places that, for many people, while staring off the side, provides answers for their most troubling issue or deep question, whether they were looking for the answer or not.
  * Lover's Glade -- Two sequoia trees whose bases are over a hundred feet apart have grown together and connect about 160 to 180 feet off the ground. The branches and leaves of these giant trees create a pleasantly shaded area below which is often used by the local populace as sites of wedding ceremonies.
