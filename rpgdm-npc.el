;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Choosing a good NPC is about the location:
;;      - City
;;      - Town
;;      - Village
;;      - Road
;;      - Feywild, etc.
;;
;;    As this will really affect the occupation.
;;
;;    Also, the /purpose/ may also change whether we are looking for a companion
;;    or guild, or just a random person on the street.
;;
;;    Obviously, I won't worry about giving incorrect answers, as anything that
;;    doesn't /fit/ will just be ignored.
