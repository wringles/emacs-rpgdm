;;     This package includes all the help and support I can think for the Game
;;     Master running a role-playing game.
;;
;;     This include a minor mode, `rpgdm' that adds a few keybindings useful
;;     with either org-mode or markdown-formatted files.

The formula is based on the NUMBER-OF-DICE. According to the
Players Handbook in Dungeons and Dragons, we have this table

But I read somewhere that you could roll some 6 sided die to help
add a bit of randomness to the leve setting. Essentially, roll
the 6d and add 7.
